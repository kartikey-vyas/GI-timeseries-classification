# Kartikey's Log

This is document will serve as a progress log for my part 4 project. It is written in markdown.

## Setting up a development environment

Since I am working from a Windows 10 PC, I decided to use a Linux distribution that I run natively on windows through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2). This contains a linux kernel that runs alongside windows - it is like a lightweight VM.

### Technologies Used

- WSL 2 - Windows Subsystem for Linux
  - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Installed miniconda on ubuntu
  - conda 4.8.2
  - python 3.7.4
  - jupyter core 4.6.1
  - jupyter-notebook 6.0.3
- Git for version control
  - github repo: <https://github.com/kartikey-vyas/engsci700-project37>
- Windows Terminal >_
- VS Code
  - VS Code Remote (connects to WSL Ubuntu)
  - GitLens
- Cookie Cutter Data Science template

### Workflow

1. Open windows terminal. This will automatically start Ubuntu 18.04 running on WSL 2. `win + 1`
2. `cd engsci700-project37 && code .` to open project folder in VS Code.
3. *insert jupyter notebook workflow here once figured out*

This set up will be used going forward from 13/03.

## Friday 13 March

- Meeting with Peng (see meeting minutes)
- Organise time to see Andreas after reading time-series docs and getting started with `tsfresh`
- Continue literature review, start with the MEA documents sent by Peng.
