Started with Markdown as a log using [Markdown and Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown?fbclid=IwAR1Y7I6vyp4QvUq57frUk-NKwY-bZRNwcU2Cn_B8eS3ybC0qT6pQQnl1fFk) as a guide. Installed `markdownlint`, `Markdown TOC`, `Markdown Shortcuts`, and `Markdown Preview Enhanced`. Potential extensions to consider are `Markdown Theme Kit`, `Markdown Preview Github Styling`.

`Ctrl + K` `V` to open preview.

### Friday 13<sup>th</sup> March <!-- omit in toc -->

Installed `Markdown All in One` and `Markdown Preview Github Styling`, and uninstalled `Markdown TOC` and `Markdown Shortcuts`.

Meeting with Peng (technical info).

*Improving the Traditional Information Management in Natural Sciences* &mdash; discusses using timestamps as a way of managing data. I think in the case of our project, this isn't too relevant, as we are not collecting any data ourselves and practicing standard version control is sufficient.

## Week 3

### Wednesday 18<sup>th</sup> March <!-- omit in toc -->

To omit entries from the table of contents, include `<!-- omit in toc -->` at the end of the line. To create a TOC, `Ctrl + P` and type `> Markdown All in One: Create Table of Contents`.

Completed and summarised all *Best Practices* readings. Read chapter 1 of *Hands-On ML*.

Completed chapter 2 of *Hands-On ML*. Quite a good chapter, goes through an entire end-to-end project; may be worth going back and having another read in future. Jupyter notebook stored in OneDrive, and source code for the book can be found [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml).
