#Meeting Minutes

---

###Friday 13<sup>th</sup> March

- First three folders contain data for analysis
- 0 - baseline; 1 - first drug; 2 - second drug; each file approx. 3 minutes in length
- Fourth folder contains simulation files
- filt_data and filt_t, 1000Hz, 60 electrodes by 180 seconds
- summary.xlsx contains Peng's comments on the data; poor data may also just mean no activity; unclear pretty much means poor as well;
- Atropine is always the second drug applied, initially assume the effect of drug 1 is independent of the effects of drug 2
- example_2d.com - loads in geometry (set); system of ODE's; probably won't be making many changes, really minor changes only probably
- Reading output into MATLAB, and matching simulation output with real data by changing parameters
- Don't change equations initially (only after research), start with parameters
- Initial parameter guesses are from previous tests which were independent of each other
- Once registered on hpc, can run simulation on server
- Get started with looking at files and getting things running
- After getting through "starting point" literature, we'll need to do more searches (PubMed recommended)
- Every week, find no more than 1-2 papers and do a quick summary
- Not human data, safe medical data, ethically approved - not traceable back to original subject; no concerns about hosting data online
