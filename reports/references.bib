	abstract = {Gastrointestinal (GI) problems give rise to 10 percent of initial patient visits to their physician. Although blockages and infections are easy to diagnose, more than half of GI disorders involve abnormal functioning of the GI tract, where diagnosis entails subjective symptom-based questionnaires or objective but invasive, intermittent procedures in specialized centers. Although common procedures capture motor aspects of gastric function, which do not correlate with symptoms or treatment response, recent findings with invasive electrical recordings show that spatiotemporal patterns of the gastric slow wave are associated with diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment response. We here consider developing non-invasive approaches to extract this information. Using CT scans from human subjects, we simulate normative and disordered gastric surface electrical activity along with associated abdominal activity. We employ Bayesian inference to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of estimating gastric surface activity from cutaneous recordings. We utilize a prior distribution on the spatiotemporal activity pertaining to sparsity in the number of wavefronts on the stomach surface, and smooth evolution of these wavefronts across time. We implement an efficient procedure to construct the Bayes optimal estimate and demonstrate its superiority compared to other commonly used inverse methods, for both normal and disordered gastric activity. Region-specific wave direction information is calculated and consistent with the simulated normative and disordered cases. We apply these methods to cutaneous multi-electrode recordings of two human subjects with the same clinical description of motor function, but different diagnosis of underlying cause. Our method finds statistically significant wave propagation in all stomach regions for both subjects, anterograde activity throughout for the subject with diabetic gastroparesis, and retrograde activity in some regions for the subject with idiopathic gastroparesis. These findings provide a further step towards towards non-invasive phenotyping of gastric function and indicate the long-term potential for enabling population health opportunities with objective GI assessment.},

	abstract = {Time-frequency (TF) based machine learning methodologies can improve the design of classification systems for non-stationary signals. Using selected TF distributions (TFDs), TF feature extraction is performed on multi-channel recordings using channel fusion and feature fusion approaches. Following the findings of previous studies, a TF feature set is defined to include three complementary categories: signal related features, statistical features and image features. Multi-class strategies are then used to improve the classification algorithm robustness to artifacts. The optimal subset of TF features is selected using the wrapper method with sequential forward feature selection (SFFS). In addition, a new proposed measure for TF feature selection is shown to improve the sensitivity of the classifier (while slightly reducing total accuracy and specificity). As an illustration, the TF approach is applied to the design of a system for detection of seizure activity in real newborn EEG signals. Experimental results indicate that: (1) The compact kernel distribution (CKD) outperforms other TFDs in classification accuracy; (2) a feature fusion strategy gives better classification than a channel fusion strategy; e.g. using all TF features, the CKD achieves a classification accuracy of 82\% with feature fusion, which is 4\% more than the channel fusion approach; (3) the SFFS wrapper feature selection method improves the classification performance for all TFDs; e.g. total accuracy is improved by 4.6\%; (4) the multi-class strategy improves the seizure detection accuracy in the presence of artifacts; e.g. a total accuracy of 86.61\% with one vs. one multi-class approach is achieved i.e. 0.91\% more than the binary classification approach. The results obtained on a large practical real data set confirm the improved performance capability of TF features for knowledge based systems.},

	abstract = {Objective
Research in seizure prediction from intracranial EEG has highlighted the usefulness of bivariate measures of brainwave synchronization. Spatio-temporal bivariate features are very high-dimensional and cannot be analyzed with conventional statistical methods. Hence, we propose state-of-the-art machine learning methods that handle high-dimensional inputs.
Methods
We computed bivariate features of EEG synchronization (cross-correlation, nonlinear interdependence, dynamical entrainment or wavelet synchrony) on the 21-patient Freiburg dataset. Features from all channel pairs and frequencies were aggregated over consecutive time points, to form patterns. Patient-specific machine learning-based classifiers (support vector machines, logistic regression or convolutional neural networks) were trained to discriminate interictal from preictal patterns of features. In this explorative study, we evaluated out-of-sample seizure prediction performance, and compared each combination of feature type and classifier.
Results
Among the evaluated methods, convolutional networks combined with wavelet coherence successfully predicted all out-of-sample seizures, without false alarms, on 15 patients, yielding 71\% sensitivity and 0 false positives.
Conclusions
Our best machine learning technique applied to spatio-temporal patterns of EEG synchronization outperformed previous seizure prediction methods on the Freiburg dataset.
Significance
By learning spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG synchronization, pattern recognition could capture patient-specific seizure precursors. Further investigation on additional datasets should include the seizure prediction horizon.},

	abstract = {Objective
A new clinical seizure waning system for intracerebral EEG is proposed. It is aimed at a better performance than existing systems and at user tuneability.
Methods
The system employs data filtering in multiple bands, spectral feature extraction, Bayes' theorem, and spatio-temporal analysis. The a priori information in Bayes' theorem was provided by 407h of EEG from 19 patients having 152 seizures.
Results
The testing data (19 patients, 389h, 100 seizures, independent of the training data) yielded a sensitivity of 89.4\%, a false detection rate of 0.22/h, and median delay time of 17.1s when tuning was used, and 86\%, 0.47/h and 16.2s without tuning. Missed seizures were of short duration or had subtle seizure activity. False detections were caused by technical artefacts, non-epileptic large amplitude rhythmic bursts or very low amplitude activity. It was established that performance could easily be tuned. Results were also compared to the clinical system of Gotman (1990).
Conclusions
The system offers a performance that is acceptable for clinical use. User tuneability allows for reduction in false detection with minimal loss to sensitivity.
Significance
Epilepsy monitoring generates large amounts of recordings and requires intense observation. Automatic seizure detection and warning systems reduce review time and facilitate observation. We propose a method with high sensitivity and few false alarms.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy, a neurological disorder in which patients suffer from recurring seizures, affects approximately 1\% of the world population. In spite of available drug and surgical treatment options, more than 25\% of individuals with epilepsy have seizures that are uncontrollable. For these patients with intractable epilepsy, the unpredictability of seizure occurrence underlies an enhanced risk of sudden unexpected death or morbidity. A system that could warn the patient of the impending event or trigger an antiepileptic device would dramatically increase the quality of life for those patients. Here, we proposed a patient-specific algorithm for possible seizure warning using machine learning classification of 34 algorithmic features derived from EEG–ECG recordings. We evaluated our algorithm on unselected and continuous recordings of 12 patients (total of 108 seizures and 3178-h). Good out-of-sample performances were observed around 25\% of the patients with an average preictal period around 30min and independently of the EEG type (scalp or intracranial). Inspection of the most discriminative EEG–ECG features revealed that good classification rates reflected specific physiological precursors, particularly related to certain stages of sleep. From these observations, we conclude that our algorithmic strategy enables a quantitative way to identify “pro-ictal” states with a high risk of seizure generation.},

The rhythmic contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is governed by pacemaker electrical potentials, also termed slow waves, which are calcium currents generated by interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs). Malfunction of pacemaker rhythms contributes to a number of clinically challenging gastrointestinal motility disorders.
Method
A microelectrode array (MEA) was used to record slow waves in vitro from intact GI tissues freshly isolated from the ICR mouse and Suncus murinus. The effects of temperature, extracellular calcium and potassium concentrations on pacemaker potentials were quantified using spatiotemporal metrics.
Results
Pacemaker frequency decreased from the duodenum to the ileum in the mouse, but this phenomenon was less significant in Suncus murinus. In both the mouse and Suncus murinus, the stomach had a much lower pacemaker frequency than the intestine. Propagation velocity and amplitude were highest in the proximal intestine. Temperature significantly increased pacemaker frequency in the intestinal tissues of both species. Removal of Ca2+ from the medium inhibited pacemaker potential and increasing the Ca2+ concentration increased pacemaker frequency in the mouse ileum. Increasing K+ concentration decreased pacemaker frequency in the absence of nifedipine.
Conclusions
The MEA allows efficient investigation of gut pacemaker frequency and propagation.},

However, recent progress has been substantial, with technical advances, theoretical insights and experimental discoveries offering new translational opportunities. The discoveries that interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) generate slow waves and that ICC defects are associated with dysmotility have reinvigorated gastric arrhythmia research. Increasing evidence now suggests that ICC depletion and damage, network disruption and channelopathies may lead to aberrant slow wave initiation and conduction. Histological and high-resolution (HR) electrical mapping studies have now redefined the human ‘gastric conduction system’, providing an improved baseline for arrhythmia research. The application of HR mapping to arrhythmia has also generated important new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of arrhythmia onset and maintenance, resulting in the emergence of new provisional classification schemes. Meanwhile, the strong associations between gastric functional disorders and electrogastrography (EGG) abnormalities (e.g. in gastroparesis, unexplained nausea and vomiting and functional dyspepsia) continue to motivate deeper inquiries into the nature and causes of gastrointestinal arrhythmias. In future, technical progress in EGG methods, new HR mapping devices and software, wireless slow wave acquisition systems and improved gastric pacing devices may achieve validated applications in clinical practice. Neurohormonal factors in arrhythmogenesis also continue to be elucidated and a deepening understanding of these mechanisms may open opportunities for drug design for treating arrhythmias. However, for all translational goals, it remains to be seen whether arrhythmia can be corrected in a way that meaningfully improves organ function and symptoms in patients.},

EGG is attractive because it is non-invasive. However, due to its non-invasive nature, there have also been controversies regarding validity and applications of EGG. The aim of this review is to discuss the methodologies, validation and applications of EGG. Pros and cons of EGG will also be discussed in detail. First, the gastric slow wave and its correlation with gastric motility are presented. The association between gastric dysrhythmia and impaired gastric motility is reviewed. Secondly the method for recording the electrogastrogram is presented in detail and pitfalls in the recording and analysis of EGG are discussed. Thirdly, findings reported in the literature demonstrating the accuracy of EGG in recording gastric slow waves and gastric dysrhythmia are reviewed and discussed. The correlation of the electrogastrogram with gastric contraction is carefully discussed. Finally, applications of EGG in a few major areas are reviewed.},

Specifically, input from the extrinsic nerves or hormones is not required to generate or organize them. The smooth muscle cells and the enteric neurons are the core cell types that together regulate motility function autonomously (Figure 9). However, input from external sources (sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons; paracrine, endocrine, and exocrine hormones; inflammatory mediators or stress mediators) may influence the myogenic and enteric neuronal regulation to modify the characteristics of gut contractions in response to changes in the external environment. The autonomic nerves do not directly innervate the smooth muscle cells. Instead, they modulate the activity of the enteric nervous system, which, in turn, affects the overall motility function.},

	abstract = {Intestinal smooth muscle contracts rhythmically in the absence of nerve and hormonal stimulation because of the activity of pacemaker cells between and within the muscle layers. This means that the autonomic nervous system modifies rather than initiates intestinal contractions. The practical described here gives students an opportunity to observe this spontaneous activity and its modification by agents associated with parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve activity. A section of the rabbit small intestine is suspended in an organ bath, and the use of a pressure transducer and data-acquisition software allows the measurement of tension generated by the smooth muscle of intestinal walls. The application of the parasympathetic neurotransmitter ACh at varying concentrations allows students to observe an increase in intestinal smooth muscle tone with increasing concentrations of this muscarinic receptor agonist. Construction of a concentration-effect curve allows students to calculate an EC50 value for ACh and consider some basic concepts surrounding receptor occupancy and activation. Application of the hormone epinephrine to the precontracted intestine allows students to observe the inhibitory effects associated with sympathetic nerve activation. Introduction of the drug atropine to the preparation before a maximal concentration of ACh is applied allows students to observe the inhibitory effect of a competitive antagonist on the physiological response to a receptor agonist. The final experiment involves the observation of the depolarizing effect of K+ on smooth muscle. Students are also invited to consider why the drugs atropine, codeine, loperamide, and botulinum toxin have medicinal uses in the management of gastrointestinal problems.},

Gastric slow waves are generated and propagated by the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). All regions distal to the dominant pacemaker area in the corpus are capable of generating slow waves, but orderly gastric peristalsis depends upon a frequency gradient in which the corpus pacemaker frequency exceeds the antral frequency. Cholinergic, muscarinic stimulation enhances pacemaker frequency. We investigated this phenomenon using intact murine gastric muscles and cultured ICC. Acetylcholine (ACh) increased the frequency of slow waves in antrum and corpus muscles. The increase was significantly greater in the antrum. ACh and carbachol (CCh) increased the pacemaker currents in cultured ICC. At high doses of CCh, transient pacemaker currents fused into sustained inward currents that persisted for the duration of stimulation. The effects of CCh were blocked by low doses of the M3 receptor antagonist 1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium. Frequency enhancement by CCh was not affected by forskolin, but the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 inhibited both the increase in frequency and the development of tonic inward currents. 2-Aminoethyldiphenyl borate also blocked the chronotropic responses to CCh. Inhibitors of protein kinase C did not block responses to CCh. These studies show that mice are an excellent model for studying mechanisms that regulate gastric slow-wave frequency. CCh, apparently via production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, accelerates the frequency of pacemaker activity. High concentrations of CCh may block the entrainment of pacemaker currents, resulting in a tonic inward current.},

frequencies. In a coupled 1D model, the simulated slow waves were entrained to a
single frequency; whereas in an uncoupled 1D model, the simulated slow waves
occurred at different frequencies, resulting in loss of entrainment. The new
cell model presents an option for future large multi-scale simulations of
gastric slow waves in intact ICC network and diseased conditions where the loss
of entrainment may lead to slow wave dysrhythmias and diminished gastric

The presence of a mutation in a patient with a motility disorder, however, does not automatically imply a cause-effect relationship between the two. Patch clamp experiments on HEK-293 cells previously established that the R76C mutation altered Nav1.5 channel function. Here the process through which these data were quantified to create stationary Markov state models of wild-type and R76C channel function is described. The resulting channel descriptions were included in whole cell ICC and SMC computational models and simulations were performed to assess the cellular effects of the R76C mutation. The simulated ICC slow wave was decreased in duration and the resting membrane potential in the SMC was depolarized. Thus, the R76C mutation was sufficient to alter ICC and SMC cell electrophysiology. However, the cause-effect relationship between R76C and intestinal pseudo-obstruction remains an open question.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims:
Estimates of disease burden can inform national health priorities for research, clinical care, and policy. We aimed to estimate health care use and spending among gastrointestinal (GI) (including luminal, liver, and pancreatic) diseases in the United States.

Methods:
We estimated health care use and spending based on the most currently available administrative claims from commercial and Medicare Supplemental plans, data from the GI Quality Improvement Consortium Registry, and national databases.

Results:
In 2015, annual health care expenditures for gastrointestinal diseases totaled \$135.9 billion. Hepatitis (\$23.3 billion), esophageal disorders (\$18.1 billion), biliary tract disease (\$10.3 billion), abdominal pain (\$10.2 billion), and inflammatory bowel disease (\$7.2 billion) were the most expensive. Yearly, there were more than 54.4 million ambulatory visits with a primary diagnosis for a GI disease, 3.0 million hospital admissions, and 540,500 all-cause 30-day readmissions. There were 266,600 new cases of GI cancers diagnosed and 144,300 cancer deaths. Each year, there were 97,700 deaths from non-malignant GI diseases. An estimated 11.0 million colonoscopies, 6.1 million upper endoscopies, 313,000 flexible sigmoidoscopies, 178,400 upper endoscopic ultrasound examinations, and 169,500 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures were performed annually. Among average-risk persons ages 50–75 years who underwent colonoscopy, 34.6\% had 1 or more adenomatous polyps, 4.7\% had 1 or more advanced adenomatous polyps, and 5.7\% had 1 or more serrated polyps removed.

Conclusions:
GI diseases contribute substantially to health care use in the United States. Total expenditures for GI diseases are \$135.9 billion dollars annually—greater than for other common diseases. Expenditures are likely to continue increasing.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: 
        Digestive diseases account for {\textgreater}100 million ambulatory care visits annually in the U.S. Yet, comparatively less is known about the true burden of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in the general U.S. population. The aim of this study was to use data from the “National GI Survey”—a population-based audit of GI symptoms in {\textgreater}71,000 participants—to determine the prevalence and predictors of GI symptoms in community-dwelling Americans.
        METHODS: 
        We conducted the National GI Survey using a mobile app called MyGiHealth, which employs a computer algorithm that systematically collects participants' GI symptoms. We recruited a nationally representative sample of Americans to complete the survey, which guided respondents through National Institutes of Health (NIH) GI Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) scales along with questions about relevant comorbidities and demographics. We measured the prevalence of GI symptoms in the past week and employed logistic regression to adjust for confounding.
        RESULTS: 
        Overall, 71,812 individuals completed the survey, of which 61\% reported having had ≥1 GI symptom in the past week. The most commonly reported symptoms were heartburn/reflux (30.9\%), abdominal pain (24.8\%), bloating (20.6\%), diarrhea (20.2\%), and constipation (19.7\%). Less common symptoms were nausea/vomiting (9.5\%), dysphagia (5.8\%), and bowel incontinence (4.8\%). Females, non-Hispanic whites, and individuals who were younger, highly educated, and had medical comorbidities were more likely to have symptoms (all adjustedp{\textless} 0.05).
        CONCLUSIONS: 
        In this large population-based study that combined digital health technology with NIH PROMIS questionnaires, we found that GI symptoms are highly prevalent, as nearly two thirds of surveyed Americans are burdened by these symptoms.},

Slow waves are generated and actively propagated by interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). The initiation of pacemaker activity in the ICC is caused by release of Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor–operated stores, uptake of Ca2+ into mitochondria, and the development of unitary currents. Summation of unitary currents causes depolarization and activation of a dihydropyridine-resistant Ca2+ conductance that entrains pacemaker activity in a network of ICC, resulting in the active propagation of slow waves. Slow wave frequency is regulated by a variety of physiological agonists and conditions, and shifts in pacemaker dominance can occur in response to both neural and nonneural inputs. Loss of ICC in many human motility disorders suggests exciting new hypotheses for the etiology of these disorders.},

Due to the complexity of the GI tract and the substantial volume of material that could be covered under the scope of GI physiology, this chapter briefly reviews the overall function of the GI tract, and discusses the major factors affecting GI physiology and function, including the intestinal microbiota, chronic stress, inflammation, and aging with a focus on the neural regulation of the GI tract and an emphasis on basic brain-gut interactions that serve to modulate the GI tract. GI diseases refer to diseases of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and rectum. The major symptoms of common GI disorders include recurrent abdominal pain and bloating, heartburn, indigestion/dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. GI disorders rank among the most prevalent disorders, with the most common including esophageal and swallowing disorders, gastric and peptic ulcer disease, gastroparesis or delayed gastric emptying, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many GI disorders are difficult to diagnose and their symptoms are not effectively managed. Thus, basic research is required to drive the development of novel therapeutics which are urgently needed. One approach is to enhance our understanding of gut physiology and pathophysiology especially as it relates to gut-brain communications since they have clinical relevance to a number of GI complaints and represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of conditions including inflammatory diseases of the GI tract such as IBD and functional gut disorders such as IBS.},

The lack of spatial and temporal resolution using current EGG methods presents a significant roadblock to more widespread usage. Human and preclinical studies have shown that GI myoelectric electrodes can record signals containing significantly more information than can be derived from abdominal surface electrodes. The current study sought to assess the efficacy of multi-electrode arrays, surgically implanted on the serosal surface of the GI tract, from gastric fundus-to-duodenum, in recording myoelectric signals. It also examines the potential for machine learning algorithms to predict functional states, such as retching and emesis, from GI signal features. Studies were performed using ferrets, a gold standard model for emesis testing. Our results include simultaneous recordings from up to six GI recording sites in both anesthetized and chronically implanted free-moving ferrets. Testing conditions to produce different gastric states included gastric distension, intragastric infusion of emetine (a prototypical emetic agent), and feeding. Despite the observed variability in GI signals, machine learning algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, were able to detect the state of the stomach with high overall accuracy ({\textgreater}75\%). The present study is the first demonstration of machine learning algorithms to detect the physiological state of the stomach and onset of retching, which could provide a methodology to diagnose GI diseases and symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.},

	abstract = {Muscarinic agonists and antagonists are used to treat a handful of gastrointestinal (GI) conditions associated with impaired salivary secretion or altered motility of GI smooth muscle. With regard to exocrine secretion, the major muscarinic receptor expressed in salivary, gastric, and pancreatic glands is the M3 with a small contribution of the M1 receptor. In GI smooth muscle, the major muscarinic receptors expressed are the M2 and M3 with the M2 outnumbering the M3 by a ratio of at least four to one. The antagonism of both smooth muscle contraction and exocrine secretion is usually consistent with an M3 receptor mechanism despite the major presence of the M2 receptor in smooth muscle. These results are consistent with the conditional role of the M2 receptor in smooth muscle. That is, the contractile role of the M2 receptor depends on that of the M3 so that antagonism of the M3 receptor eliminates the response of the M2. The physiological roles of muscarinic receptors in the GI tract are consistent with their known signaling mechanisms. Some so-called tissue-selective M3 antagonists may owe their selectivity to a highly potent interaction with a nonmuscarinic receptor target.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the relative capabilities of methods for magnetic and electric detection of gastrointestinal electrical activity is presented. The model employed is the first volume conductor model for magnetic fields from GEA to appear in the literature. A mathematical model is introduced for the electric potential and magnetic field from intestinal electrical activity in terms of the spatial filters that relate the bioelectric sources with the external magnetic fields and potentials. The forward spatial filters are low-pass functions of spatial frequency, so more superficial external fields and potentials contain less spatial information than fields and potentials near the source. Inverse spatial filters, which are reciprocals of the forward filters, are high-pass functions and must be regularised by windowing. Because of the conductivity discontinuities introduced by low-conductivity fat layers in the abdomen, the electric potentials recorded outside these layers required more regularisation than the magnetic fields, and thus, the spatial resolution of the magnetic fields from intestinal electrical activity is higher than the spatial resolution of the external potentials. In this study, two smooth muscle sources separated by 5 cm were adequately resolved magnetically, but not resolved electrically. Thus, sources are more accurately localized and imaged using magnetic measurements than using measurements of electric potential.},

Invasive studies in humans have described normal and abnormal propagation of the slow wave. This study aims to disambiguate the abnormally functioning wave from one of normalcy using multi-electrode abdominal waveforms of the electrogastrogram (EGG). Methods: Human stomach and abdominal models are extracted from computed tomography scans. Normal and abnormal slow waves are simulated along stomach surfaces. Current dipoles at the stomachs surface are propagated to virtual electrodes on the abdomen with a forward model. We establish a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to classify normal and abnormal slow waves from the multi-electrode waveforms. We investigate the effects of non-idealized measurements on performance, including shifted electrode array positioning, smaller array sizes, high body mass index (BMI), and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We compare the performance of our deep CNN to a linear discriminant classifier using wave propagation spatial features. Results: A deep CNN framework demonstrated robust classification, with accuracy above 90\% for all SNR above 0 dB, horizontal shifts within 3 cm, vertical shifts within 6 cm, and abdominal tissue depth within 6 cm. The linear discriminant classifier was much more vulnerable to SNR, electrode placement, and BMI. Conclusion: This is the first study to attempt and, moreover, succeed in using a deep CNN to disambiguate normal and abnormal gastric slow wave patterns from high-resolution EGG data. Significance: These findings suggest that multi-electrode cutaneous abdominal recordings have the potential to serve as widely deployable clinical screening tools for gastrointestinal foregut disorders.},

solve for time series classification and regression in industrial applications

their significance for the classification or regression task, while controlling
the expected percentage of selected but irrelevant features. The proposed
algorithm combines established feature extraction methods with a feature
importance filter. It has a low computational complexity, allows to start on a
problem with only limited domain knowledge available, can be trivially
parallelized, is highly scalable and based on well studied non-parametric
hypothesis tests. We benchmark our proposed algorithm on all binary
classification problems of the UCR time series classification archive as well

In contrast, the independent samples t-test, which is also a test of two groups, requires the single variable to be measured at the interval or ratio level, rather than the ordinal level, and to be normally distributed. We accordingly refer to the Mann-Whitney U test as the nonparametric version of the parametric t-test. Both tests require two independently sampled groups and assess whether two groups differ on a single, continuous variable. The two tests, however, differ on the assumed distribution. A nonparametric test assumes no specific distribution, whereas a parametric test assumes a specific distribution. Thus, the Mann-Whitney U is conceptually similar to the t-test for determining whether two sampled groups are from a single population. When data do not meet the parametric assumptions of the t-test, the Mann-Whitney U tends to be more appropriate.},

The objective of this study is to present results obtained with the random forest classifier and to compare its performance with the support vector machines (SVMs) in terms of classification accuracy, training time and user defined parameters. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data of an area in the UK with seven different land covers were used. Results from this study suggest that the random forest classifier performs equally well to SVMs in terms of classification accuracy and training time. This study also concludes that the number of user‐defined parameters required by random forest classifiers is less than the number required for SVMs and easier to define.},

This study aims at diagnosing and prognosticating breast cancer with a machine learning method based on random forest classifier and feature selection technique. By weighting, keeping useful features and removing redundant features in datasets, the method was obtained to solve diagnosis problems via classifying Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis Dataset and to solve prognosis problem via classifying Wisconsin Breast Cancer Prognostic Dataset. On these datasets we obtained classification accuracy of 100\% in the best case and of around 99.8\% on average. This is very promising compared to the previously reported results. This result is for Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset but it states that this method can be used confidently for other breast cancer diagnosis problems, too.},

	abstract = {Cross-validation is a mainstay for measuring performance and progress in machine learning. There are subtle differences in how exactly to compute accuracy, F-measure and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) in cross-validation studies. However, these details are not discussed in the literature, and incompatible methods are used by various papers and software packages. This leads to inconsistency across the research literature. Anomalies in performance calculations for particular folds and situations go undiscovered when they are buried in aggregated results over many folds and datasets, without ever a person looking at the intermediate performance measurements. This research note clarifies and illustrates the differences, and it provides guidance for how best to measure classification performance under cross-validation. In particular, there are several divergent methods used for computing F-measure, which is often recommended as a performance measure under class imbalance, e.g., for text classification domains and in one-vs.-all reductions of datasets having many classes. We show by experiment that all but one of these computation methods leads to biased measurements, especially under high class imbalance. This paper is of particular interest to those designing machine learning software libraries and researchers focused on high class imbalance.},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of time series data across almost all human endeavors has produced a great interest in time series data mining in the last decade. While dozens of classification algorithms have been applied to time series, recent empirical evidence strongly suggests that simple nearest neighbor classification is exceptionally difficult to beat. The choice of distance measure used by the nearest neighbor algorithm is important, and depends on the invariances required by the domain. For example, motion capture data typically requires invariance to warping, and cardiology data requires invariance to the baseline (the mean value). Similarly, recent work suggests that for time series clustering, the choice of clustering algorithm is much less important than the choice of distance measure used.In this work we make a somewhat surprising claim. There is an invariance that the community seems to have missed, complexity invariance. Intuitively, the problem is that in many domains the different classes may have different complexities, and pairs of complex objects, even those which subjectively may seem very similar to the human eye, tend to be further apart under current distance measures than pairs of simple objects. This fact introduces errors in nearest neighbor classification, where some complex objects may be incorrectly assigned to a simpler class. Similarly, for clustering this effect can introduce errors by “suggesting” to the clustering algorithm that subjectively similar, but complex objects belong in a sparser and larger diameter cluster than is truly warranted.We introduce the first complexity-invariant distance measure for time series, and show that it generally produces significant improvements in classification and clustering accuracy. We further show that this improvement does not compromise efficiency, since we can lower bound the measure and use a modification of triangular inequality, thus making use of most existing indexing and data mining algorithms. We evaluate our ideas with the largest and most comprehensive set of time series mining experiments ever attempted in a single work, and show that complexity-invariant distance measures can produce improvements in classification and clustering in the vast majority of cases.},
